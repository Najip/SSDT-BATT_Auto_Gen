# SSDT-BATT_Auto_Gen

A Python script to automatically generate an SSDT-BATT from your DSDT.

> **I continue this project since `ECEnabler` only supports Field Unit objects larger than `8` bit (1 byte) for `EmbeddedControl` regions but not in `SystemMemory` OperationRegions. This script still useful for `SystemMemory` based EC found on some Laptops where if Field unit objects larger than `32` bit (4 bytes), battery won't work. SSDTs generated by this Python3 script fixes that.   
I re-open the scripts repo so anyone can contribute to improve this WIP. I will archive this repo if [@eric_kwok](https://github.com/the-eric-kwok) re-open the main Repo.**
